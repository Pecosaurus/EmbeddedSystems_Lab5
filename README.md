ADC code file with one of them interacting with one sensor and another ADC code file interacting with to sensors


The Program for Question 1 uses the ADC, PMM register, interrupts, and functions to Read the Data from the internal temperature sensor in the board, then use the Anolog digital Convertor, which was configure in a function call ConfigurAdc_temp1(). In this ConfigureAdc_temp1(), The ADC is turned on, the temperature sample period is set to 30 us, the ADC Sample and Hold Pulse Mode Selection is set to being sourced from th sampling timer. Also in this function, the ADC conversion Sequence Mode was set to Signle-channel, single conversion, sets the ADC to the MODOSC mode, sets teh ADC resolution to a 12-bit conversion result, sets the ADC Reference Voltage ti VR+ = VREF and VR- to AVSS, and setting the ADC input channel Seledt to the on-chip temperature sensor. Then in the program Reads the ADC Converted Data into the a long variable. Finally, the program calculates the temperature in C using the 30C and 85C High Temperature Temperature Semsor Calibration and then calculating the temperature in degrees F from the temperature value in degrees C. The program repeats this process until the program is stopped.

The Program for Question 2 uses the ADC, PWM, PMM register, interrupts, and functions to Read the Data from the DHT11 humdity and temperature sensor and internal temperature sensor in the board, then use the Anolog digital Convertor to change this analog value to a digital value before it is turned to the temperature values in degrees c and degrees F. In the ADC configuration part of the program, The ADC is turned on, the temperature sample period is set to 30 us, the ADC Sample and Hold Pulse Mode Selection is set to being sourced from th sampling timer. Also in this function, the ADC conversion Sequence Mode was set to Squence-of-Channels conversion, sets the ADC to the MODOSC mode, sets teh ADC resolution to a 12-bit conversion result, sets the ADC Reference Voltage ti VR+ = VREF and VR- to AVSS, and setting the ADC input channel Select for the DHT11 to Pin P1.1. The ADC configureation also sets the ADC input channel Select for internal temperature sensor to A12 or on-chip temperature sensor. Now the ADC is Configurated. 
For DH11 temperature Data, the program Reads the ADC Converted Data from the DHT11 into the a long variable. Finally, the program calculates the temperature in C using the 30C and 85C High Temperature Temperature Semsor Calibration and then calculating the temperature in degrees F from the temperature value in degrees C. 
For the Internal Temperature Sensor Data, the program Reads the ADC Converted Data from the DHT11 into the a long variable. Finally, the program calculates the temperature in C using the 30C and 85C High Temperature Temperature Semsor Calibration and then calculating the temperature in degrees F from the temperature value in degrees C. 
The program repeats this process of reading the data from the DH11 humidty and temperature sensor and the internal temperature sensor, doing the ADC conversion to these values and then turning these data values into temperature value in degrees C and degrees F until the program is stopped.
